# It's called "Keepwords"
🔐 Keepwords is a simple native iOS password app. 
- ❌☁️ No iCloud. 
- 👨‍💻100% local.

## No Pods Installation!
The only thing that makes an app project too complicated is them adding **pods**. Not easy to open. In Keepwords, we don't use pods because we value the best true user experience, which is simplicity. It's really that simple.
```bash
installation = No pods from us!
installation = true
```
