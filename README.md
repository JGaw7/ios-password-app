# It's called "Keepwords"
🔐 Keepwords is a simple native iOS password app. 
- ❌☁️ No iCloud. 

- ❌🌱 No Pods

- 👨‍💻100% local.

## Installation
No pods installation. The only thing that makes an app project too complicated is them adding **pods**. Not easy to open. In Keepwords, we don't use pods because we value the best user experience for you. 
```bash
no pods intallation = true
```
